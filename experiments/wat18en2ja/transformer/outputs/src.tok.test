The virus inspection and immunoserologic inspection of BALF and blood plasma were carried out for 14 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) patients and of 8 patients hospitalized for IPF acute aggravation .
The cytokine which significantly increased in BALF in the acute aggravation stage compared with the IPF stable stage was high in 13 types out of 17 type measured , and especially IL-6 , TNFα and IFNγ tended to be high in the poor prognosis cases .
In 3 cases of BALF reexamination during the acute aggravation treating process , IL-2 , IL-5 and IL-6 showed decreasing tendencies by the treatment regardless of prognosis , and IL-8 , IFNγ and TNFα showed the upward tendencies in the poor prognosis cases .
In the blood plasma , IL-6 , IL-7 , IL-8 and IL-10 significantly increased in the acute aggravation stage compared with the stable stage .
The basic disease state of bronchial asthma is chronic airway inflammation .
In airway inflammation , various cells such as eosinophils , T-cells , mast cells , neutrophils , macrophages and airway epithelium , and various liquid factors are involved .
It is taken seriously that Th2 cytokine is involved not only in central airway , but also in peripheral airway , in the position of airway inflammation .
In addition , the disease states of airway remodeling such as the peeling of tracheal epithelial cell and turning into embryonic cell , basal membrane thickening , hypertrophy and hyperplasia of tracheal smooth muscle , and angiogenesis are clarified , which bring about irreversible airway closure and chronically intensify airway anaphylaxia to cause the asthma to become serious and intractable .
For the treatment of asthma , it is important to introduce antiinflammatory drugs , mainly inhalation steroids , from the early stage , for the suppression of the remodeling of airway in addition to the control of allergic inflammation .
The features of bronchial asthma are repeated paroxysmal stridor , dyspnea and cough , which tend to appear at night and in early morning , and in the auscultation finding , the sound is continuous A , especially harmonic flute-like sound .
In addition , objective evaluation of air flow restriction by a respiratory function test is necessary for the diagnosis of asthma .
It is evaluated by spirometry or peak flow meter , and airway hypersensitivity test is performed .
The evaluation of airway inflammation is performed by sputum test , measurement of nitrogen monoxide concentration in the expiration , expiration condensate measurement , and allergological examination .
The diseases which cause stridor and dyspnea , such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , insufficiency of left heart and hyperventilation syndrome are the object of the differentiation .
What are important in the clinical diagnosis are , 1 ) that a symptom which derives from air flow restriction occurs paroxysmally and repeatedly , 2 ) that reversibility is shown , at least partially , in the air flow restriction , and 3 ) that other diseases are excluded .
As a result of our genetic analysis , the possibility that IL-17F gene fulfills an important role in the disease state of asthma is guessed .
PAI-1 may be deeply involved in the formation of airway remodeling , and the functional polymorphism of PAI-1 gene seems to be one of the genetic factors which regulate whether airway remodeling easily progresses or not .
CCL5 is a chemokine induced strongly from airway epithelium in viral infection , and especially , it may fulfil an important role for the acquisition of chronic airway inflammation in high-age asthma .
When the attention was paid to the role of macrophage inhibitory factor , it was guessed that natural immune system is deeply involved in the disease state of allergy .
From the above , the understanding of the disease was deepened by clarifying the pathophysiological common pathway at the molecular level .
By making these pathways to be a target , it is expected to contribute to the advance in the prevention and treatment of asthma .
