The author has developed a mesh ‐ unit analysis method of static landscape images using the eye mark recorder as a direct determination method of characteristic visual behaviors to allow a quantitative evaluation of village landscapes .
As a result it became possible to quantify psychological evaluation of landscape from attention characteristic indexes such as diffusion of focus of attention and degree of concentration .
The degree of concentration became higher as the touch of village , favorable images and image fixation increased , while the diffusion of focus of attention decreased .
Analysis of the landscape images by setting landscape evaluation and visual cognition indexes respectively on ordinate and abscissa can lead to clarification of the relation among constituents within the images and landscape evaluation .
This paper introduces the research results on heat and drought stress resistance in the reproductive growth stage of snap bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris ) .
Under heat and drought stress , morphological and physiological differences in growth occur such as cultivation optimal timing , plant water physiology , and photosynthesis parameter , depending on genotype .
The water content of leaves is deeply related with heat and drought stress resistance .
Resistant cultivars suppress drop in leaf water content in heat and drought , by decreasing the growth of above-ground part and water potential of leaves .
Therefore , as the evaluation index of heat and drought stress resistance of this crop , the water content of leaves is more suitable than water potential .

The selective felling was based on the execution method established by Mr. Kyosuke Matsukawa in 1935 .
As a result , more than 5,000 seedlings / ha were confirmed even in every forest stand , after whose felling 5 years had passed .
Therefore , it was considered that the renewal had been sufficiently finished 5 years after felling .
And it was possible to grasp the renewal pattern of Thujopsis dolabrata with the time course .
Though hoof disease is abounding in the accident of disease and injury , other locomotorial disease is more frequent in the culling accident in lactating and beef cattle .
It is indicated that the hoof causes the injury of the other locomotorium .
In beef cattle , the change of the hoof influences the bone directly , affecting soft tissues .
In the meantime , in lactating dairy cow , the change of the hoof injures the soft tissue , and it shifts to the bone .
In the treatment of the hoof disease , it is desirable that the treatment interval is gradually extended after " biodynamic treatment " except for the infectious disease .
Sex pheromones are used as agricultural chemicals for pest control in three aspects of occurrence survey , mass attraction and killing , and communication disturbance .

The mass transfer phenomenon in a carrier is examined in lactic fermentation by immobilization lactic bacteria .
Simulation shows that storage of a growth inhibitor ( lactic acid in a free state ) is observed in the carrier .
In addition , peculiar diffusion behavior of the lactate ion is clarified .
That is , lactic acid in a free state and hydrogen ion are diffused outside from the inside of the carrier at the starting ‐ up stage of both batch and continuous fermentation , but lactate ion is diffused inside from the surface of the carrier .
This is to occur by addition of basic solution for controlling pH of the culture solution .
It is shown that the production rate of lactic acid is improved by utilizing a buffer instead of the basic solution to lower diffusing inside the lactate ion carrier .

The verification as to whether the selection of recipients as well as the brain death decision were appropriately and properly carried out has been severely performed , but it can be scarcely said that sufficient consideration has been given to the feeling of the donor 's family .
This study intended to carry out the groping on an ideal way of the mental care for the donor 's family , considering this point .
The literature research which covered studies of this kind in foreign countries was carried out in this fiscal year .
The number of the papers concerning the mental care in the transplantations reported between 1966 and 2002 was 49 in all , but the objects of most researches were recipients among the research objects .
Since the reference result showed that there were two reports on the mental care for donors and only one report of 1998 on the mental care for donor 's families , it was clarified how scanty the researches on the mental care for donors were even in foreign countries .
The origin of the airway remodeling due to airway inflammation was examined using the components in the airway local sputum of the toddler asthma in its crisis early stage .
As the result , in the bronchial asthma group who repeated the stridor , the MMP-9 concentration concerned in the airway remodeling was higher as compared with that in the first-time stridor group of the children who were later diagnosed as toddler asthma .
And this MMP-9 concentration in the first-time stridor group showed significant positive correlations with the ECP derived from eosinophils which were the airway inflammation mediators or the neutrophil elastase concentration derived from neutrophils .
It was indicated from the above result that the airway inflammation due to neutrophils as well as eosinophils from the suckling stage might have already been concerned in induction of the airway remodeling .
Branched IPMT is emitting the edge in the mucus pancreas cancer advocated by Ohashi et al. as pancreatic carcinoma with the good prognosis .
Though branched IPMT was confused by the pancreatic duct expansion form with the pancreas mucoid cyst tumor , it is widely known that these are different diseases by recognizing the interstitial tissue which resembles the ovarium .
And , the difference with carcinoma in situ ( CIS ) which is the precursor lesion of the pancreatic duct cancer of the infiltration becomes a discussion for this tumor , since it belongs to the tumor in the pancreatic duct .
Though expansion , mucus production , papillary proliferation of the pancreatic duct , etc.is important in the differentiation , there is some the differentiation on the difficult case .
The following were examined in spontaneous chronic pancreatitis of the male WBN / Kob rat : Its crisis and progression , the relation between apoptosis of pancreatic acinic cells and the T cells , and the therapeutic effect of tacrolimus .
At the age of 15 weeks , the CD4 - and CD8-positive cells infiltrated the pancreatic leaflets or between the leaflets , and especially the CD8-positive T cells were located close to the pancreatic acinic cells with the apoptosis caused .
The apoptosis of the pancreatic acinic cells , the infiltration of the CD4 - and CD8-positive cells , and the progression of pancreatitis were almost perfectly suppressed by administration of tacrolimus .
It was indicated that the CD8-positive T cells fulfiled an important role in induction of apoptosis of the pancreatic acinic cells and in progression of chronic pancreatitis , and tacrolimus could become a therapeutic drug for chronic pancreatitis .
The Fukukoukai Soumu Hospital opened as a mental care / complication ward on the occasion of the transfer to a new hospital in June , 2001 .
A study was performed on the effect of this change in the environment , in the aspects such as the open counter , curtains positioned to maintain the space around the bed , or the relation with the nurse as the human environment .
